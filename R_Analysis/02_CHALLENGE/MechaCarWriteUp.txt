# MPG Regression
After running the multiple linear regression on the MechaCar_mpg datasets, the model returns that the vehicle length and ground clearance have p-value significantly smaller than the significant level (assuming at 5%). Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which means their slopes of the linear model are not considered to be zero. In other words, these variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

In addition, the intercept p-value is also statistically insignificant (less than 5%), it means there are other variables and factors that contribute to the variation in the dependent value that have not been included in our model. Also, the R-squared at 71.49% implies a strong correlation of these coefficients, which could predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

# Suspension Coil Summary
The Suspension Coil PSI dataset statistics show a mean of 1452 PSI, the median value is 1500, with a standard deviation of 7.89 and variance of 62.29. Since the design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Since the variance value is 62.29, the current manufacturing data meets this design specification.

# Suspension Coil T-Test
Before starting to do t-test, we plot the dataset to see how the data was distributed. The qualitative test for normality shows a bell curve shape. However, in the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, the p-value is siginificantly less than 5%. Therefore, the PSI dataset is NOT normally distributed. This is breaking the one of the t-test assumptions, so we cannot run the test anymore. We might need to add more data points or resample the data to fix this.

However, let us assume the dataset were normally distributed and conduct the t-test. Since we already have the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch, we should do the one-sample t-test. The p-value returned 0.06, which was higher than our significant level of 5%. Thus, there was not enough sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis: no statistical difference between the suspension coilâ€™s PSI results and its population mean of 1500.

# Design My Own Study
According to this article on NACS (https://www.convenience.org/Media/Daily/2018/Aug/8/ND0808182_Fuel-Price-Not-a-Factor-in-Vehicle-Choic), the three factors consumers consider when buying a vehicle are utility, affordability, and efficiency. In addition, I would like to add the horsepower engine as another metric since that will decide the speed of the vehicle. Therefore, I would like to create a model to look into these factors on the market and see how MechaCar is performing against them.

The dependent value will be the number of vehicles sold for each type of vehicle. We would like the most recent data for the model and make sure the sample is good enough, so we would need the 2019 sales of at least 50 different vehicles in the market. The independent variables will be the passenger capacity (for utility), sales price (for affordability), and mileage per gallon (mpg, for efficiency), and hp (horsepower) for each type of vehicles. In addition, we would also need a population mean of sales for all comparable vehicles in the market in 2019.

The first question will be is our sample data a good representative of the population? We need to conduct a one-sample t-test in order to answer that. However, we need to make sure our sample sales dataset is normally distributed first, using both the qualitative and quantitative test for normality. Then the one-sample t-test should be good to conduct: the null hypothesis is that there is no statistical difference between the sample sales mean and its population sales mean, and the alternative hypothesis is that there is a statistical difference between the sample sales mean and its population sales mean. Our goal is to reject the null hypothesis, to ensure our sample is a good representative of the population.

Next, since we are having multiple variables that may affect the vehicle performance, we will use the multiple linear regression model to find the answer if there are correlations between the three factors and the sales numbers. The test purpose is to check each metric to reject whether the null hypothesis (the slope of the linear model is zero), or the alternative hypothesis (the slope of the linear model is not zero). Also, this test would help us answer how accurate is this model to compare the performance of the MechaCar prototype vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market.
